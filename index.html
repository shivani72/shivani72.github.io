<td valign="baseline"><p> <br> <br> After taking classes that dealt with Adobe Photoshop, InDesign, and Dreamweaver, I dug deeper and discovered the realm of programming. Having explored C++ and Java in high school, I am now a freshman at the <a href="http://illinois.edu/">University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign</a> hoping to go deeper into the world of Computer Science. I am interested in UX Design and mobile app development. My hobbies include acting, playing Badminton, and listening to different kinds of music-ranging from Taylor Swift to Eminem to Bassnectar. In my spare time I also like to cook, shop, go hiking, or read Harry Potter for the millionth time. </p><br></td>
