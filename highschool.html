<td valign="baseline"><p> <br> <br> As part of the International Project Committee at Interact Club during my junior year, I organized events to raise money for refugees in Afghanistan. It was a rewarding experience especially at our biggest event of the year where I helped out backstage and I knew the memories and bonds I was making with my fellow members were nothing close to the impact we were making by raising money and awareness.  </p><br></td>

<td valign="baseline"><p> <br> <br> Freshman year, I wrote and performed a monologue on how essay is a metaphor for life. The memories backstage bonding with cast members and the confidence I built through this experience are some things I truly value.

<td valign="baseline"><p> <br> <br> I played Badminton, Girls Doubles and Singles, which served as an outlet. It was a way for me to relax and take a break from the monotony of school, learning valuable collaboration skills at the same time as I had to adjust to playing with different partners.
